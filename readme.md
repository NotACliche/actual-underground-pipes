Have you ever felt that piping things under buildings was too easy? That dragging a pipe to ground along was just... not fun?

Well no more! Now, with Actual Underground Pipes, you need to build the underground pipes! Using the same keybind for changing rail layer (default: ALT + G) change between aboveground and underground pipes! No extra items, no complex GUIs, no new recipes, just one keybind! *Note: pipes have been removed from pipe to ground recipes to compensate. No new items, recipes, or technologies are required; just press the keybind and any normal pipes in your inventory can be used as underground pipes.*

Underground pipes have the same restrictions as normal pipe to grounds. This means you can't build them across lava or space.

# TODO
- toggleable "alt mode" where a visualization is placed over underground pipes so they can be seen easier
- update logic to only mine the category that is in the player's hand

# Known Issues
- Pipe to Grounds have a phantom pipe cover when not connected. It's not fixable without removing the pipe covers of pipe to grounds entirely, and it only shows up when they aren't connected, so I don't see it as a major issue.

Supports all mods, hopefully. If something doesn't work, let me know!

If you have a mod idea, let me know and I can look into it.
